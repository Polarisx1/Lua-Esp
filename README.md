# Lua ESP Script

This repository contains a Lua script originally intended for use in Roblox.

## Running Tests

Tests are written using the [Busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/)
framework. To run them, make sure `busted` is installed and available in your
`PATH`.

```bash
busted
```

The tests stub the Roblox APIs so they can run in a normal Lua environment.
